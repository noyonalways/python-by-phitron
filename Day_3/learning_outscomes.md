# Slove the problems from Day-1 and Day-2

## problem 1 Square check:

    length = int(input('input length: '))
    breadth = int(input('input breadth: '))
    if length == breadth:
        print('it is square')
    else:
        print('it is not square')

## problem 2: Find larg number:

    a = int(input('input a : '))
    b = int(input('input b : '))
    c = int(input('input c : '))
    if a >= b and a >= c:
        print(a, 'a is larg number rather than others')
    elif b >= a and b >= c:
        print(b, 'b is a large number rather than others')
    elif c >= a and c >= b:
        print(c, 'c is a large number rather than others')

# Problem 3: Check even or odd number:

    number = int (input('input number for check even or odd: '))
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number, ': it is even number')
    else:
        print(number, ': it is odd number')

# problem 4: Write a Program to take integer input from user and display the grade according to the following criteria:

    studentMarks = int(input())
    if studentMarks > 90:
        print(studentMarks, ": Grade A")
    elif studentMarks > 80 and studentMarks <= 90:
        print(studentMarks, ": Grade b")
    elif studentMarks >= 60 and studentMarks <= 80:
        print(studentMarks, ": Grade c")
    elif studentMarks < 60 :
        print(studentMarks, ": Grade d")

# Problem 5: Check leap year:

    inputYear = int(input('input year: '))
    if inputYear % 100 == 0 and inputYear % 400 == 0:
        print(inputYear, ': it is leap year')
    elif inputYear % 4 == 0 and inputYear % 100 != 0:
        print(inputYear, ': it is leap year')
    else:
        print(inputYear, 'it is not leap year')

# Practice Problems From Day 1 and Day 2

### Problem 1 :
Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from user and check if it is square or
not.

### Problem 2 :
Take three integer input from user and find the largest number between using if-elif-else statement.

### Problem 3:
Write a program using conditional Statement whether a number is even or odd. (even means divisible by 2 and odd mean not divisible by 2)
Suppose user provide input as 15 then it will print "15 is an odd number"



### Problem 4 :
Write a Program to take integer input from user and display the grade according to the
following criteria.

|      Marks      	| Grade 	|
|:---------------:	|:-----:	|
|       > 90      	|   A   	|
|  > 80 and <= 90 	|   B   	|
| >= 60 and <= 79 	|   C   	|
|     below 60    	|   D   	|

### Problem 5:
Write a Program to check whether a year is leap year or not. Take input from User.

example: if year = 1996, it is a leap year

Conditions for leap year:

- 1. If a year is divisible by both 400 and 100 it is a leap year.
- 2. If a year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 it is a leap year.
